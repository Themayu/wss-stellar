                <h1>Client-side code</h1>
								<p>
									Client-side code is code that is downloaded and executed by the user’s browser, hence the names “Client side”
									and "front-end code." This code tends to be used to provide extra functionality to a web page, as well as to
									allow users to interact with different controls on the webpage to allow them to do many things a static website
									wouldn't allow them to do.
								</p>
                <p>
                  Client-side code is almost exclusively written in the JavaScript interpreted scripting language, though some
                  implementations of interactivity can be added through Adobe’s Shockwave Flash technology or even the now-
                  defunct Java Applet system, which allowed websites to execute compiled Java programs in the context of the website.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Client-side code is executed in the user’s browser, which means that it is executed on the user’s computer system
                  and has access to their browser’s internal storage; including cookie storage, if applicable. This opens up a major
                  example of what client-side code would be used for: Single-Page Application (SPA) websites.
                </p>

								<h2>Single-Page Applications</h2>
								<p>
                  A Single-Page Application is a website that, instead of being comprised of multiple different web pages, is comprised
                  of a single web page that can hold multiple “states” and, due to the lack of explicit loading in the foreground, will
                  never connect to the server to get a new version of the file. These applications rely heavily on JavaScript being
                  enabled in order to serve the user, as literally everything performed on the site - from simple page transitions to
                  form data submission - is handled with non-default behaviour on the client side.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A typical SPA website would make heavy use of Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (“AJAX” for short) to communicate with
                  the web server, which would send back small snippets of data in either the JavaScript Object Notation format, or “JSON”
                  for short; or in plain HTML, which could be inserted into the document without issue. HTML would be inserted directly
                  into the document, while JSON-formatted data would be parsed in order to build a final “update” to apply to the webpage
                  in question. The use of AJAX processing would mean that the website would never have to refresh its sole web page,
                  due to the requests being entirely asynchronous and occurring in the background.
                </p>

								<h2>Responsive form validation</h2>
								<p>
                  Client-side code can also be used to provide a responsive, interactive way of showing errors in a form before the client
                  sends this information to the server-side code to be processed. While it it is discouraged to validate form information
                  solely on the front-end, client-side code can provide a way to show errors to the user that do not require the user to
                  first submit information to the back-end, reducing the amount of data transferred between client and server as the server
                  does not have to send back a generated web page to display errors to the user, due to the front-end having already made
                  them aware of said errors and helped them to fix the problems at hand. You would still perform form validation on the back-
                  end, however, as JavaScript can be turned off on the front-end and JavaScript files are easy to modify during travel between
                  server and client. Tools such as Fiddler can even allow a user to substitute a server file for a modified copy on the
                  client’s computer.
                </p>
