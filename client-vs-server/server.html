                <h1>Server-side code</h1>
								<p>
									Server-side code is code that exists solely on the web server itself, and isn't seen at all by the client. Server-
									side code is often used to perform operations on the server in response to the client opening up certain web pages
									or performing certain actions on the client-side. It can also be used to generate HTML that is then sent to the
									client-side, a technique that is known as “HTML Templating.” Server-side code is often referred to as “back-end code.”
								</p>
								<p>
									All code written with server-side scripts is executed by the server itself, which means that it isn't seen by the
									client and, therefore, cannot be modified by the user in the way client-side code can. This code does have its own
									security vulnerabilities, however, which largely stem from the fact that it often has access to the entire server’s
									resources.
								</p>
								<p>
									There are multiple server-side languages out there, as well as multiple interpreters to allow these languages to be used
									on the web. Some common examples of server-side scripting languages are Ruby, the PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, and
									Microsoft's ASP.NET, though due to the rising popularity of the NodeJS runtime program, JavaScript is likely to join this
									list soon if it hadn't already.
								</p>
								<p>
									Server-side code has its own uses that are separate from client-side code, such as secure form validation and providing
									persistence of information:
								</p>

								<h2>Form validation</h2>
								<p>
                  A major advantage of server-side code is that it cannot be modified by the client, meaning that it can safely be used to
									perform actions that can be sensitive. One such action is the validation of what a user has entered into a HTML form.
									Server-side scripts can read what a user has entered into a form on a website and perform a series of actions to ensure
									this information matches a certain criteria set by the website owner, processing it only partially or even refusing to
									process it at all if not, at which point it would often display an error message to the user. This can be useful for when
									a user has to submit their email address to sign up for a newsletter or a website, as the site can actually ensure that
									the email address is well-formed and valid before storing it.
                </p>

								<h2>Persistence of information</h2>
								<p>
                  Server-side code can be used to allow a server to store information that has been given to it by a specific client to be
									used later on in the website’s operation. This would often be achieved by linking the code to a database that also runs on
									the server, and allows the website to hold onto data that has been given to it, such as credentials for a registration form
									or personally-identifiable information. It can store usernames and passwords as “accounts”, allowing a user to log into their
									account later on by simply entering the username and password given when it was created, and allowing the website to check to
									ensure those credentials are correct or not. Server-side code can do this despite the “statelessness” of the Hypertext
									Transfer Protocol, because all the information is stored solely on the server and often kept track of via a unique identifier
									(a “Session ID”) given to each client.
                </p>
