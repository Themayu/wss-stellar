                <h1>Accessibility techniques</h1>
                <p>
                  There are also numerous accessibility features that web server scripting can allow for the employment of
                  on a per-user or per-system basis. These features are outlined below.
                </p>

								<h2>Alternative text</h2>
								<p>
                  Web servers can be programmed to prove alternative ways of displaying or phrasing specific keywords or
                  phrases in the original document being served to the user, or even the entire document itself. An example
                  of this can be found when working with websites that provide locale-based automatic translations of a
                  webpage’s content so that it may be read in a user’s native language instead of the universal English
                  language, potentially making it easier for the end user to read the content of the site as they don't have
                  to deal with mentally translating the content themselves. A second example of alternative text can be for
                  the website to automatically “dumb down” certain content or replace it with user-requested substitutes on
                  a per-user basis, allowing the reader to feel more comfortable with what they are reading.
                </p>

								<h2>Resizable fonts</h2>
								<p>
                  Web server scripts, due to their ability to inject HTML into the final page before it is sent to the end
                  user’s browser, can also provide the ability to resize fonts and have the new size persist across pages,
                  potentially making the site easier to use by those who have trouble with their vision or need extra help with
                  reading content in front of them.
                </p>

								<h2>Support for screen readers</h2>
								<p>
                  A major ability of web server scripting is to make a website accessible to those who use screen readers.
                  Because screen readers are designed to read through text content of a website in a meaningful way, they are
                  often hard to code a website around due to the often commonplace use of images on web pages. Web server
                  scripts can be used to provide additional information for, or even text to replace image content in the
                  event that the web page is loaded in a Screen Reader, allowing the reader to more easily read the page
                  contents out to its user.
                </p>

								<h2>Adjustable fonts</h2>
								<p>
                  The ability for web server scripts to inject HTML into the final file sent to the browser window means that
                  scripts can insert custom CSS, meaning that the default font family property for a website can be overridden
                  inline or even via custom linked CSS files. This allows alternative fonts to be provided in place of the website
                  default, meaning that the web pages can be made easier to read for those that require a specific font due to
                  vision troubles or reading difficulties.
                </p>
