                <h1>Ethical issues</h1>
								<p>
									In addition to the many security issues that can arise from the use of server side scripts on a website, there are also
									numerous ethical problems that must be taken into account. There are five main issues here, each broken down into its
									own header:
                </p>

								<h2>Cookies</h2>
								<p>
									A cookie is a text file stored inside a user’s browser by a web server. This text file is then sent along with any future
									requests to the web server, allowing it to use that information to identify a certain action it must take. Cookies are
									often used to distinguish between different users accessing a certain web page or even the website itself, allowing the web
									server to determine whether they are authorised to take certain actions or not.
                </p>
                <p>
									It is often required for a website to tell its users, whether via a pop-up or in a banner visible by the user in question,
									when it uses cookies and what it uses them for. This is because cookies take up space on the user's hard drive, and because of
									this the user could potentially accuse the company who own the website of trying to tamper with their property if they do not.
                </p>

								<h2>Third-party cookies</h2>
								<p>
									Third-party cookies are cookies that are set or made accessible by different services currently employed by the web page a user
									is visiting. Unlike first-party cookies, third-party cookies do not originate on the actual website being visited; instead, they
									originate from websites that content, such as images and scripts, are being pulled from in order to be used in the web page.
									The most prominent use of third-party cookies is for advertising purposes - by storing a cookie in the browser, an advertisement
									company can then constantly track that browser’s activity and deliver more “personalised” ads that they believe this particular
									user is more likely to click through.
                </p>
								<p>
									As with first-party cookies, a website is obligated to tell its users when third-party cookies are being set on their machine.
								</p>

								<h2>EU directive (consent)</h2>
								<p>
									The Data Protection Directive is a directive adopted in 1995 by the European Union in order to regulate the processing of personal
									information inside the EU. The Directive incorporates all seven principles of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
									Development’s “Recommendations of the Council Concerning Guidelines Governing the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of
									Personal Data.”
								</p>
								<p>
									The directive states that personal information should not be processed in any way other than which has been made obvious to the user
									providing the information in question. This user must give consent to their information being processed whether automatically or
									manually by a company. This processing may only be for legitimate purposes, and the information must be protected against misuse.
								</p>

								<h2>Local data storage</h2>
								<p>
									Storage of data locally can allow that information to stay persistent and be accessible later on by the server, whether to be edited
									or displayed to visitors or the website owner later on. This information storage technique, while useful for ensuring that data is
									not lost when given by a user, can result in issues if it turns out that the server is in fact storing information that it isn't supposed
									to, such as information about a user that the user in question did not give it permission to store, or information about a user’s
									computer or web browser that site visitors have no way of knowing is being retained by the website they are visiting. This can become
									a major problem because this information can then be used to track the habits of users on the site, as well as be made available to
									other people that might be interested if the website were to be successfully attacked.
								</p>

								<h2>Faking web statistics</h2>
								<p>
									Faking website statistics is a major problem when it comes to hosting a website, especially if that site were gaining revenue from
									advertisements displayed to users. Advertisers pay a company based on the amount of times their advertisements have been seen by a
									visitor to the company’s web pages, and require the company to collect statistics as proof that a specific number of advertisements were
									made visible. To fake these statistics would allow a company to increase advertising revenue by misleading their advertising partners into
									thinking that more people saw the adverts than in reality, causing the advertiser to pay out more money to the website owner.
