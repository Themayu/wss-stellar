                <h1>Security issues</h1>
								<p>
									The first category of issues with server side scripting is the security problems that can be opened up by improper coding,
									lack of validation in certain areas, or even the accidental exposure of information where you wouldn't expect information
									to even be accessible. Most errors can be split up even further and placed under four main headers, which are described
									below:
								</p>

								<h2>Code vulnerabilities</h2>
								<p>
									Vulnerabilities can be opened up in a website in numerous different ways, each with their own different ways of affecting
									the site’s usability and functionality. There are two common methods of attacking a website that rely on little more than
									the programmer's own failure to use specific techniques when storing and accessing information: SQL injection and Cross-
									Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
								</p>
								<p>
									SQL injection, as the name suggests, deals with injecting values into an SQL query that would then later be executed against
									a database to store or retrieve information. SQL injection can be used to log into accounts without using a password, insert
									or destroy arbitrary data on a database - even removing entire schemes if the attacker wishes to - or even create
									administrator-level accounts on the website. SQL injection can also be used to bypass most protections against XSS attacks,
									which can potentially double the amount of danger it poses to a website.
								</p>
								<p>
									Cross-Site Scripting is a second problem when it comes to attempting to mitigate vulnerabilities in a program, since it mostly
									deals with how information is actually parsed before being inserted into a database. If there are no safeguards against HTML
									being inserted into a database entry that contains a user’s profile page, for example, that user could insert a HTML “script”
									tag containing custom JavaScript that would then be executed by any browser being used to access that user page. Since JavaScript
									has the ability to access other websites, the script in question could potentially push a user’s session to an external site,
									allowing the owner of this second site to steal the user’s account.
								</p>

								<h2>Bad scripting</h2>
								<p>
									Vulnerabilities can also be opened up outside of the database and inside the actual web pages themselves through improper use of
									server side scripting. This can open up “backdoors” into the site that can be used by attackers to inject their own content into
									the website’s pages or even extract things such as user credentials or API keys used to authenticate with other services. It could
									also allow attackers to use the web interface to upload and execute malicious software or scripts on the server. When writing a
									website, it is paramount for a developer to ensure that they leave as few holes as possible inside their scripts; preferably zero
									at all if possible.
                </p>

								<h2>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</h2>
								<p>
									The use of Transport Layer Security, especially SSL, on a website can seriously increase the security of that website by encrypting
									information passed between the server and the client. This can render information such as login details and banking information as
									unreadable by anyone “listening in” on the network connection used to access a website. SSL requires a signed public/private key
									pair to be accessible to the website’s code, so that it may encrypt information being passed to the client and decrypt information
									being passed to it from the client. SSL itself isn't enough, however, as it is easy to sign an “SSL certificate” yourself and use
									that for your website. Use of a trusted SSL certificate signing company to sign your SSL certificate can ensure that visitors are
									confident that your website is safe and secure, and that information they enter on it isn't likely to end up in the hands of others.
								</p>

								<h2>Password liabilities</h2>
								<p>
									A major issue that arises when speaking about storage of user credentials is the topic of how to keep such credentials safe and
									secure. This issue itself mainly arises when passwords are not secured in a safe, non-reversible way such as vis a hashing algorithm
									before being stored in a database. Password liabilities can also become a major problem when there is inadequate protection against
									things such as brute-force and dictionary attacks against an account in an attempt to get its password. Brute force attempts every
									single combination that is available in an attempt to catch passwords that are non-standard, while a dictionary attack is an attack
									that uses a pre-compiled list in order to work much faster at the cost of potentially being unsuccessful.
								</p>
								<p>
									These methods are often invisible to websites, however a script can easily be programmed “guess” that an attack is occurring by
									detecting a large amount of incorrect login attempts against a specific account within a short timeframe.
