								<h1>Features of web server scripting</h1>
								<p>
									The list of positives and negatives for the use of server-side scripting is rather large, but the main
									three in each sections are as follows:
								</p>

								<h2>Positives</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>
										Interpreted scripts as an alternative to compiled code: when writing computer programs--especially
										large ones--it can be rather tedious to make small changes and then have to wait for the compiler to
										run through the entire program to convert it into machine-readable bytecode, a process that can take
										hours for extremely large programs. Interpreted scripting allows a developer to make changes and then
										simply save the changes to the script, and the interpreter will pick up the changes without fail. This
										can save a lot of time due to the lack of a required compilation step.
									</li>

									<li>
										These scripts can also use much less processor cycle time and memory than a compiled, dedicated program
										can, meaning that the overall resource overhead is much smaller. Interpreters can be added to and removed
										from a web server with ease and without much effort, allowing for easy sharing and reuse of code without
										as much compatibility overhead.
									</li>

									<li>
										Server-side scripting can also allow hosting services like GoDaddy and Hostinger to mask the underlying
										interface of their web servers with a nicely designed web page that gives the customer an easy but
										effective way to change the settings of a server they have rented instead of forcing them to use the
										native server console.
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h2>Negatives</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>
										The inclusion of web server scripting in a website means that there is more code to test and ensure the
										functionality of, which can mean that it takes more time to develop the website overall. At the same time,
										a script can be much more complicated to maintain in the long run because of the increased testing and code
										complexity required to perform operations that would most likely be simpler to do with compiled code. At the
										same time, there could be many more security issues in a script, which could mean even more testing and work
										to ensure a script cannot be used to breach the server itself, whether by accident or deliberately.
									</li>

									<li>
										There is a marked decrease in performance when using web server scripts, the core of which can be found at one
										of their largest time-saving advantages: the fact that they are interpreted instead of compiled. This means
										that they can end up running slower as the system needs to spend extra time converting each line to bytecode
										as it is read, meaning that it spends more CPU cycles executing each line than it would were it normal bytecode.
									</li>
								</ul>
