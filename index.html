											<h3>Server Languages</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											There are numerous languages used in server-side scripting, especially when it comes to scripting websites. The
											most popular languages are: PHP; ASP.net; and JSP, or “JavaServer Pages.”
										</p>
										<p>
											Scripts created in these languages are more often than not executed solely on the server and are not interacted
											with in any way by the client other than through information sent by the client’s web browser to the server
											when a request is made. They tend to be used to generate HTML markup that can then be displayed in the web
											page itself, though these languages can be used for many operations on the back-end that aren’t necessarily
											transparent to the client.

											<h3>Functionality</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Web Server Scripting has many uses on the modern Internet, with its roots in many application types used today.
											Server-side scripting languages are used on nearly every website you visit today, and power lots of different
											services, making possible such things as shopping websites and order reservations for restaurants. The software
											is often used for user profile services, allowing users to sign up to a website and manage their own custom
											“profile”; allowing expression through a personalised page that allows things such as a custom display name and
											image to be shown to other users. Other things that web server scripting allows for are website analysis and
											uploading of files to another system, through normal HTTP or specialised File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server
											software.

									<h2>Client- and Server-Side</h2>
								</header>

								<p>
									There are multiple major differences between client- and server-side code when it comes to writing the code for a
									website, and both must be taken into account, as well as the decision of which you want to use for each section of
									your website. This section will speak about the differences between the two, as well as provide information to help
									you decide which one would be best in each scenario.
								</p>

								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style1 fa-desktop"></span>
										<h3>Client-Side</h3>

										<p>
											Client-side code is code that is downloaded and executed by the user’s browser, hence the names “Client side”
											and "front-end code." This code tends to be used to provide extra functionality to a web page, as well as to
											allow users to interact with different controls on the webpage to allow them to do many things a static website
											wouldn't allow them to do.
										</p>

										<p>
											Client-side code is almost exclusively written in the JavaScript interpreted scripting language, though some
											implementations of interactivity can be added through Adobe’s Shockwave Flash technology or even the now-
											defunct Java Applet system, which allowed browsers to execute compiled Java programs in the context of the
											website.

									</li>-->
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-connectdevelop"></span>
										<h3>Server-Side</h3>
										<p>
											Server-side code is code that exists solely on the web server itself, and isn't seen at all by the client. Server-
											side code is often used to perform operations on the server in response to the client opening up certain web pages
											or performing certain actions on the client-side. It can also be used to generate HTML that is then sent to the
											client-side, a technique that is known as “HTML Templating.” Server-side code is often referred to as “back-end code.”
										</p>
										<p>
											All code written with server-side scripts is executed by the server itself, which means that it isn't seen by the
											client and, therefore, cannot be modified by the user in the way client-side code can. This code does have its own
											security vulnerabilities, however, which largely stem from the fact that it often has access to the entire server’s
											resources.
										</p>
										<p>
											There are multiple server-side languages out there, as well as multiple interpreters to allow these languages to be used
											on the web. Some common examples of server-side scripting languages are Ruby, the PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor, and
											Microsoft's ASP.NET, though due to the rising popularity of the NodeJS runtime program, JavaScript is likely to join this
											list soon if it hadn't already.
										</p>
										<p>
											Server-side code has its own uses that are separate from client-side code, such as secure form validation and providing
											persistence of information.

									<h2>Security &amp; Ethical Issues</h2>
									<p>
										As with many computer-related systems out there today, the use of web server scripting tends to pose its own problems when
										it comes to operating on the Internet. These issues can be split into two separate categories, security problems and ethical
										issues, and must be addressed by the website creator if they don't want to run into problems with security or even end up
										breaking the law.

								<h3>Security</h3>
								<p class="content">
									The first category of issues with server side scripting is the security problems that can be opened up by improper coding,
									lack of validation in certain areas, or even the accidental exposure of information where you wouldn't expect information
									to even be accessible. Most errors can be split up even further and placed under four main headers, which are described on
									the linked page.

								<p class="content">
									In addition to the many security issues that can arise from the use of server side scripts on a website, there are also numerous
									ethical problems that must be taken into account. There are five main issues here, each broken down into its own header.
